# Quark 2014 Teaser

BITS Pilani K K Birla Goa Campus hosts annually their tech fest called Quark. For the 2014 version of Quark, a custom teaser website was designed by me from scratch. 

[Witness it here](https://bhavul.github.io/quark-2014-teaser/)

The website unfolds a complete story as you scroll through it, with beautiful color transitions and good animations, considering it was all done with help of just jQuery. 



**Note**  

* This was done back in 2014, and is just been pushed to Git quite late. So, it's no state of the art. However, it is still quite unique and beautiful in its own.
* The website best works in 1366x768 resolution screens and that was at the time majority of the target audience, as laptops back then had this screen resolution only.
